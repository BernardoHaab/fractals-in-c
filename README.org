A few fractal-generating programs from a vintage book ([[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fractal-Programming-Roger-T-Stevens/dp/1558510370/][Fractal Programming in C]]).
1989-style C code was completely rewritten, and generates [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm#File_formats][Netpbm]] files now.

The book is ok, but there's no particular reason I would recommend it over any other book.

* Compiling and running

Examples should easy to build on any Linux using a recent GCC and GNU Make:

#+begin_src shell-script
  make
  # -o for an output file
  ./mandelbrot -o output.ppm
  see output.ppm
#+end_src

Some of the programs accept additional arguments but defaults should be fine too.
